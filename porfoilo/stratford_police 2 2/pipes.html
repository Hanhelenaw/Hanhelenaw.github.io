                        <h2>The Stratford Police Pipes &amp; Drums Marching Band</h2> <br>
                        <p>In 2008, the Stratford Police Service was very  proud to welcome The Stratford Police Pipes &amp; Drums into the police family.
                        <p>The band was formed in 1986 as the Perth County  Pipe Band, under the direction of Pipe Major Reid Shepley, by past members of  the Perth Regiment Pipe Band, the Royal Canadian Regiment Pipe Band, the North  Easthope Pipe Band and the St. Mary's Pipe Band.
                        <p> In 2012, with the help of a grant from the  Ontario Trillium Foundation, the Band was outfitted with new kilts in the  Stratford Police Pipe Band Tartan. The new tartan was designed by lead drummer  Scott Baughman.
                        <p>Members  of the Stratford Police Pipes and Drums hail from Stratford, as well as  neighbouring communities in Perth, Huron, and Waterloo Counties. The Band is a  familiar attraction each year at fairs, parades and charitable events  throughout Southwestern Ontario. The Band often marches with Royal Canadian  Legion Branch 8 in Stratford, and Unit 261 of the Army, Navy and Air Force  Veterans Association, and participates in the annual Ontario Police Memorial at  Queens Park in Toronto.</p>
                        <p>Through  the summer the Band plays a series of concerts for the residents of seniors and  long term care residences in the area. One of the highlights of the Band&rsquo;s playing  season is the annual concert at the gala opening of the Stratford Festival.</p>
                        <p>In  2013, the Band will represent the Stratford Police Service for the third time at  the Ontario Police Memorial in Toronto and play for the second time during a  graduation ceremony at the Ontario Police College. These events are singularly  important to the police community and the Service is extremely proud that it  will be so well represented.</p>
