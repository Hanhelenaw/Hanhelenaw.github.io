                         <h2>A Brief History of the Stratford Police Service</h2> <br>
                        <p>It is generally thought that the first  Police Constable in Stratford  was John Augustus McCarthy, the Australian born son of a military  officer. While Stratford  was still a hamlet in the mid 19th century policing was the responsibility of  the County. </p><br>

They also assisted at special occasions such as fairs and    circuses. For $160.00 per year - plus fees,<strong> Constable Hamilton</strong> attended police court and council sessions.&nbsp;    He also ensured the town caretaker tended fires, coal-oil lamps and    candles, and prevented destruction of the town's property. He was responsible    for rounding up stray livestock, supervising ditching, road and sidewalk    construction. Additionally, he was the Truant Officer and Health &amp;    Sanitary Inspector. Traffic control was also the responsibility of the Police    and the management of livestock within the city was the primary concern.&nbsp; In fact, in <strong>1859</strong> a By-law was passed    to assist with the control of livestock by empowering the constable to impound    stray pigs.</p></td>
