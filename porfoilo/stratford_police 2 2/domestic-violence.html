                        </h2>
                        <p>There are several components of Domestic or Spousal Assault. These include physical assault, sexual assault, psychological abuse, stalking, and threats of physical assault. The term Domestic generally means that the persons involved shared some relationship. The relationship need not have received legal sanction as a marriage. There is no implied meaning by the term &quot;domestic&quot; that requires the offence to take place within a residence. Further it is not required that the involved persons actually lived together at the time of the offence. </p>
                        <p>If while investigating an allegation of Domestic Assault, the police collect reasonable grounds that an offence has been committed, charges will be laid. </p>
                        <p>The Stratford Police Services involvement in an investigation of a Domestic Assault case, is really only the beginning. Many other private and government services may become involved in the case. Theses services may include, Court both Criminal and Family, Children's Aid Society, Counselling services and agencies such as Optimism Place. </p>
                        <p>Domestic Assault is a crime. If you believe you are a victim of domestic assault or if you know someone who is contact the Police immediately. Confidential inquiries can be made by contacting </p>
