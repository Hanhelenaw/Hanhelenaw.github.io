                        <h3><em>Safety of Children Starts On Our Streets...</em></h3>
                        <p><strong>The Block Parent Program has been around for over 25 years and is Nationwide.&nbsp; Police, government departments, educators, sponsors and volunteers support the Block Parent goal of providing safer communities for children and other citizens.</strong></p>
                         <p><em><strong>How does the Block Parent Program work?</strong><br />
                         </em>Block Parents are responsible adults who care sufficiently about the well being of children and others to volunteer their homes as a refuge in an emergency. All Block Parents are screened by the Police and are given instructions on the program by local volunteers.</p>

                            <p><strong><em>What does a Block Parent Do?<br />
                            </em></strong>A Block Parent may be called upon to offer their home as a place of safety when someone is in a dangerous or frightening situation such as: </p>
