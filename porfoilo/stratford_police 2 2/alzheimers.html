                        <p>Wandering is a common behavior of individuals with  Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease or other dementia.&nbsp; The person can become hopelessly  lost anywhere, even on the front steps of their own home.&nbsp; A detour or  wrong turn can set up a panic reaction that inhibits all sense of direction,  time and purpose.&nbsp; All familiar routes and landmarks may become lost to  the person affected by Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease or other dementia.&nbsp; Getting  lost is unpredictable which is why the Stratford Police Services along with the  Alzheimer Society of Perth County recommend that persons with dementia are  registered with the MedicAlert®  Safely Home® program.</p><br>
                        <p>Personal information and a hotline number are engraved on a  MedicAlert bracelet that is worn full-time by a person with dementia.&nbsp;  Should the person ever go missing, first responders can quickly identify  him/her by calling the 24-hour, North American MedicAlert hotline with the  information found on the back of the specially designed &ldquo;blue insignia&rdquo;  bracelet.&nbsp; When first responders call the emergency hotline, MedicAlert  Specialists immediately contact family members and caregivers to let them know  the situation and location of their loved one, reducing anxiety for  everyone.&nbsp; </p><br>
                        <p>The registered person&rsquo;s identification, health records and  emergency contacts are maintained and regularly updated to ensure accurate  information is available if required.</p><br>
                        <p>The cost to register is $60 which includes one year of  MedicAlert protection plus a free MedicAlert Stainless Steel &ldquo;Blue&rdquo; ID  bracelet.</p><br>
                        <p>To register a person with dementia in the MedicAlert® Safely Home® program, there are a number  of options:<br /><br>
